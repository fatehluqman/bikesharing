## Overview of the analysis: 
The analysis involves review of CitiBike rider ship data to determine if a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a feasible business proposal. 
The analysis looks to answer the following questions:
*How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
*How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
*A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Results:

* Dashboard of the breakdown of NYC ridership for Aug 2019: shows that of 2.3 million rides, 1.9 million were subscribers and 1.5 million were male. Additionally, the top starting locations are located in Manhattan. 
* A review of Avg Trip Duration and Birth Year shows that as avg bike duration increases with younger riders. 
* Largest number of bikes were used for rides peaking at 5 minutes
* Males account for largest percentage of riders.
* Largest number of rides during weekday commuting hour.
* Males account for the highest percentage of riders during these hours.
* Accordingly, males account for highest percentage of subscribers.

## Summary: 
A summary of the results shows that by far a majority of trips originate and end in Manhattan. The trips are mostly made by men who are subscribers during weekday commuting hours. 
Interestingly the largest number of trips peak at 5 mins. This does lead to additional questions however, for instance the large number of riders who male subscribers during commuting hours are would indicate that the bike sharing is useful for work commutes. However, the short duration of trip in Manhattan indicate that potentially a large number of tourist use the bike share to travel between different tourist points.
One additional visualization could be the most common start and end point combinations. Another additional visualization that could be useful what be to determine what locations are most commonly used based on start time or end time.
These visualizations would be useful in understanding if their was popular points that people like to travel to and from and where to position additional bike stations.
